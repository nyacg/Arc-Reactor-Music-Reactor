# Arc Music Reactor
A script I used to make my Iron Man Arc reactor costume prop flash to the music.

The device is made from a ring of hot glue into which a number of LEDs have been inserted. 
The LEDs are linked to a shift register which is connected to an Amtel ATTiny85 microcontroller. The signal from an amplified electret microphone is analysed and the ATTiny decides how many LEDs to light up.
